// null is a VALUE which represents empty/nothing/unkown
let a = null;
console.log(a);

// undefine means a variable whose value is not yet defined
let x;
console.log(x);

// null is used to assign an empty value to a variable
// undefined is used to check if a variable is assigned a value

//typeof null is Object -- it is actually a bug
